Antiphon:  

The works of the | LORD are great,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought out of all them that have pleas- | ure therein.  

Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with | my whole heart,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the assembly of the upright, and in the con- | gregation.  

The works of the | LORD are great,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought out of all them that have pleas- | ure therein.  

His work is honourable and | glorious:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his righteousness endureth | for ever.  

He hath made his wonderful works to be | remembered:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD is gracious and full of | compassion.  

He hath given meat unto them | that fear him:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;He will ever be mindful of his | covenant.  

He hath shewed his people the power | of his works,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he may give them the heritage of | the heathen.  

The works of his hands are verity | and judgment;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;All of his command- | ments are sure.  

They stand fast for ever | and ever,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And are done in truth and | uprightness.  

He sent redemption unto | his people:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend | is his name.  

The fear of the LORD is the beginning | of wisdom:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A good understanding have all they that do his commandments: His praise endureth | for ever.  

Glory be to the Father and | to the Son   
&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the | Holy Ghost,  
as it was in the beginning,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;is now and e- | ver shall be,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;world without end.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A- | men, amen.  

The works of the | LORD are great,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought out of all them that have pleas- | ure therein.
