## Psalm 111

Antiphon:

The works of the | LORD are great,  
|  Sought out of all them that have pleas- | ure therein.

Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with | my whole heart,  
|  In the assembly of the upright, and in the con- | gregation.

The works of the | LORD are great,  
|  Sought out of all them that have pleas- | ure therein.

His work is honourable and | glorious:  
|  And his righteousness endureth | for ever.

He hath made his wonderful works to be | remembered:  
|  The LORD is gracious and full of | compassion.

He hath given meat unto them | that fear him:  
|  He will ever be mindful of his | covenant.

He hath shewed his people the power | of his works,  
|  That he may give them the heritage of | the heathen.

The works of his hands are verity | and judgment;  
|  All of his command- | ments are sure.

They stand fast for ever | and ever,  
|  And are done in truth and | uprightness.

He sent redemption unto | his people:  
|  He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend | is his name.

The fear of the LORD is the beginning | of wisdom:  
|  A good understanding have all they that do his commandments: His praise endureth | for ever.

Glory be to the Father and | to the Son   
|  and to the | Holy Ghost,
as it was in the beginning,
|  is now and e- | ver shall be,  
|  world without end.
|  A- | men, amen.

The works of the | LORD are great,  
|  Sought out of all them that have pleas- | ure therein.
