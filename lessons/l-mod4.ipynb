    "## Properties of Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Associative Property\n",
    "\n",
    "The way numbers are grouped in an operation (addition or multiplication) does not change the result. It applies to both addition and multiplication, but not to subtraction and division.\n",
    "\n",
    "$(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of standing in a line from left to right in the order: \n",

    "#### Me | You | Mobster with a Bad Attitude\n",
    "\n",
    "If you shake hands with me first, he'll shoot you; if you shake hands with him first, you're fine. That would mean that, because he's on your right. Shaking hands is a right-associative property for you, because you need to operate with the thing on the right first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, think of standing in line the other way:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mobster with a Bad Attitude | You | Me\n",
    "\n",
    "If the angry mobster is on your left, and you need to shake hands with him first to keep from getting shot, then that would mean that shaking hands is left-associative for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Subtraction, Division, and Combining Unlike Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subtraction and division are left-associative. You apply the operations from left to right instead of right to left.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are combining multiplication and division, the signs are left-associative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are combining addition and subtraction, the signs are left-associative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are combining something other than the stuff above that, you follow PEMDAS first, and then apply associativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't ask why this is. The reason is that if we didn't settle on something, everyone would be arguing about how to do simple arithmetic and we can't have that happen and expect to actually function in the world without going to war over minus-signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commutative Property\n",
    "\n",
    "Latin word \"commutare\" means \"to change\". That means that if you change the position of two operands, the result is the same\n",
    "\n",
    "$a+b=b+a$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributive Property\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is used to multiply or divide a single term and two or more terms inside a set of parentheses. It provides a way to multiply numbers by breaking them down into smaller parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "$a\\times(b+c) = a\\times b + a\\times c$\n",
    "\n",
    "$a\\div(b+c) = a\\div b + a\\div c$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identity Property\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an operation you can apply to numbers that leaves them unchanged: adding zero, subtracting zero, multiplying by 1, and dividing by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$a+0=a$\n",
