Antiphon:  

The works of the | LORD are great,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought out of all them that have pleas- | ure therein.  

Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with | my whole heart,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the assembly of the upright, and in the con- | gregation.  

The works of the | LORD are great,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought out of all them that have pleas- | ure therein.  

His work is honourable and | glorious:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his righteousness endureth | for ever.  

He hath made his wonderful works to be | remembered:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD is gracious and full of | compassion.  

He hath given meat unto them | that fear him:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;He will ever be mindful of his | covenant.  

He hath shewed his people the power | of his works,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he may give them the heritage of | the heathen.  

The works of his hands are verity | and judgment;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;All of his command- | ments are sure.  

They stand fast for ever | and ever,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And are done in truth and | uprightness.  

He sent redemption unto | his people:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend | is his name.  

The fear of the LORD is the beginning | of wisdom:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A good understanding have all they that do his commandments: His praise endureth | for ever.  

Glory be to the Father and | to the Son   
&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the | Holy Ghost,  
as it was in the beginning,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;is now and e- | ver shall be,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;world without end.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;A- | men, amen.  

The works of the | LORD are great,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sought out of all them that have pleas- | ure therein.

## My Heart Delights, O Lord

![Hymn Notes](./assets/img/my-heart-delights-o-lord.jpg)

1. My heart delights, O Lord, upon Thy works to ponder,  
My lips would chant the praises of Thy wondrous might;  
And so I join the chorus of the saints up yonder,  
Who magnify Thee day and night.  
2. Whate'er this great and mighty universe containeth  
Came into being straightway at Thy beck and call;  
Thou dost whate'er Thy sov'reign will, O Lord, ordaineth.  
Thou art indeed the Source of all.  
3. Some day this world will like a fleeting shadow vanish,  
Its glory like a waning light will pass away;  
But naught Thy Word of truth and might from us shall banish,  
It shall endure, O Lord, for aye.  
4. Each day anew Thy mercy prompts Thee, Lord, to feed us,  
Our grateful hearts delight in Thine unfathomed love;  
Thou into verdant pastures evermore dost lead us  
And sendest blessings from above.  
5. O may our hymns of praise to Thee be daily rising,  
May we in Thee alone behold our Fount of joy;  
May we, Thy gracious gifts in all their richness prizing,  
Be found for aye in Thine employ.  
Amen.
